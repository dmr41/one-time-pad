This program is for encrypting and decrypting messages using the one time pad
strategy.


Basic encryption Algorithm

* Encryption Class takes a string value
* Initializer evaluates string for right type and absences of non A-Z values
* Valid strings are randomized to create a one time pad
* Starting string and one time pad are used in encryption


Encryption = Starting text + One_time_pad - 1

* Used ASCII character encoding where 65 = A and 90 = Z
* Modulus used to find remainder out of 26 and then adjusted to ASCII values
* ----->(added_values-1 % 26)


** Still to build **

Decryption = Encryption - One_time_pad + 1
Decryption eval equation  = (Encryption - OTP - 1)  if positive
													= else (Encryption - OTP - 1) + 26)

---------------------------------------------------
Right now functionality causes text to ignore spacing completely.
This might be good for better encryption but harder for users to read.
Considering building a word array based method that returns and array of
1. unencoded
2. one-time-pad
3. encrypted values
